 * in a scrolling animation (up or down, depending on the scroll direction)

                    I found out the hard way that not all icons in react-icons can actually be styled (either through
                    inheriting the color from the parent, setting it manually through the CSS class, or even using
                    the IconProvider.Context API, as suggested in the react-icons documentation). Fortunately, this
                    only seems to be limited to Grommet icons (e.g., anything prefixed with "Gr"). Save yourself some
                    pain and just don't use those <3
