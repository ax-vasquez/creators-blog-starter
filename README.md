# Readme

Just another Gatsby blog starter.

## To do
1. [x] Blog feed
   * [ ] Article page
2. [ ] Bio pages
3. [ ] Project overview page
    * [ ] Project info modal

## In the future...
1. **Documentation sub-system**
    * Allow creators to use their site as a documentation source for their projects
2. **Shoutouts**
    * Some way to present curated lists of information from other sources (e.g., people whose info were referred to during a given project and the creator wants to give credit to)
      * For example, if you created a video game and used a specific YouTuber's videos as a reference, this would be a good way to share the resource with others (as well as help them out by promoting them)

## Known issues

### GatsbyJS - hot reloading doesn't work reliably
This started happening after implementing the correct setup for Tailwind. Except when making changes to the CSS file, hot reloading seems to work as it should.

**It seems this is some kind of weird issue how webpack is repackaging things under the hood for CSS changes, and only when using TailwindCSS.**
* I don't have time to dig into this more - it's annoying, but can be gotten around by simply stopping and restarting `gatsby develop`

Symptom:
```bash
warn Warning: Event "xstate.after(200)#waitingMachine.aggregatingFileChanges" was sent to stopped service "waitingMachine". This service has already reached its
final state, and will not transition.
Event: {"type":"xstate.after(200)#waitingMachine.aggregatingFileChanges"}
success Re-building development bundle - 4.482s
success Writing page-data.json files to public directory - 0.001s - 0/0 0.00/s
```
* When you see this message in the logs, **hot reloading is broken**
    * ~~It will still "look" like it's responding to changes, but it will never actually apply them~~
        * **UPDATE:** This _may_ end up working if you let it run, but it seems to end in an "out of memory" heap error more often than not - it still seems faster to simply stop and restart it, but it no longer appears to be entirely necessary

### GatsbyJS - lazy-loaded images don't resolve to full resolution when sourced from the file system
This started happening after implementing `react-redux`, specifically after adding the `Provider` component to `wrapRootElement` in both the Gatsby SSR and Gatsby Browser files.

Strangely, this doesn't seem to affect all images; just the ones on the home page. The images in the blog feed always seem to update to the full resolution. The only difference between these two image sets is that the blog feed images come from Sanity plugin and the home page images from the local filesystem plugin.
