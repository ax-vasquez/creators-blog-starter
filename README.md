# Readme

Just another Gatsby blog starter.

## To do
1. [ ] Site layout and style
2. [ ] Blog feed
   * [ ] Article page
3. [ ] Bio pages
4. [ ] Project overview page
    * [ ] Project info modal

## In the future...
1. **Documentation sub-system**
    * Allow creators to use their site as a documentation source for their projects
2. **Shoutouts**
    * Some way to present curated lists of information from other sources (e.g., people whose info were referred to during a given project and the creator wants to give credit to)
      * For example, if you created a video game and used a specific YouTuber's videos as a reference, this would be a good way to share the resource with others (as well as help them out by promoting them)
